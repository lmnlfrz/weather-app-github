I'm so proud that I completed my 8 weeks course with SheCodes Workshops! It's been challenging and amazing with all the new skills that I learn during the course.

I am able to code a weather web app from scratch through Visual Studio Code with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and API. 

Many thanks to SheCodes Team specially Jo√£o Lopes :) for all the help during the course.

Looking forward to the next challenges,to learn React.
